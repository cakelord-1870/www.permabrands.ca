With beautiful opening notes of citrus, neroli, bergamot &amp; rosemary, you’ll soon understand why President George Washington selected our Number Six as his preferred fragrance.</span></p>

Good for more than 100 shaves and made with clean ingredients - we stand by our legacy of quality and value, befitting a man’s sacred morning ritual.</span></p>

    <td colspan="2"><p data-mce-fragment="1">Working from the original handwritten recipe, we collaborated with famed perfumer Laurent Le Guernec to create a formula that is true to the original Number Six Fragrance, yet thoroughly modern. We chose floral and herbal distillations that would have been available in 1772 and blended them with natural, sustainably produced oils. And we updated the animal-derived ingredients (musk and ambergris) with cruelty-free plant-based components.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">The result is a surprisingly contemporary fragrance that opens with smooth citrus and whispers of rose and clove, fortified with a strong amber influence. The dry-down is complex, with musk, myrrh, and a smooth balance of herbal notes. It's a modern scent with a classic soul, worthy of the moniker "Supernatural."</p>

<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">HISTORY OF THE SCENT</strong>: Originally formulated in 1772, Number Six is considered America's first fragrance and the third oldest in continuous production. In 1780, America's first president discovered it at our Newport apothecary, becoming a repeat customer and gifting it to several of his friends, including the French aristocrat and American Revolutionary War commander, Marquis de Lafayette. One of the compendiums in the Caswell-Massey archive notes, our forefathers traveled by stagecoach with a flask of Number Six handy.</p>
